# 🌍 Malaria Outbreak Prediction Using Machine Learning (SDG 3)

## 📌 Project Overview
Malaria remains a major public health issue, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. This project applies machine learning to predict malaria outbreaks using WHO data to help health authorities take timely, preventive action.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict high-risk malaria outbreaks.
- Identify seasonal patterns and trends.
- Enable early intervention by healthcare stakeholders.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: World Health Organization (WHO)
- **Features**: Country, Year, WHO Region, Malaria Cases, Malaria Deaths

## 🧠 ML Models Used
- ARIMA
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation done through accuracy and comparison

## 🧪 Workflow Summary
1. Data cleaning: Handled missing values and standardized columns.
2. Feature Engineering: Added case fatality rate, years since first record, and encoded WHO region.
3. EDA: Visualized trends and anomalies.
4. Model Training: Used supervised learning to classify outbreak risk.
5. Evaluation: Compared performance of 3 models.

## 🧮 Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
