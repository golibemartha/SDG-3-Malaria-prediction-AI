Selected Target Variable

We'll define a custom binary classification target:
High_Case = 1 if the number of malaria cases in a given country/year is in the top 25% (i.e., high incidence), otherwise 0.

This approach:

Creates a meaningful logistic regression task.

Helps prioritize countries with high malaria burden.
